# Heart

Heart is an React/Redux app that uses the Rijksmuseum API to curate galleries for users. A user can select to search from one of many options to view portraits that reflect that choice. Each search option has two potential search options- a simple input, or a button that displays options, for a greater UX/UI. The app is fully tested with the use of jest/enzyme. It also uses a Firebase database to store users. This is a solo project.
